# Project Name: Image Classification with PyTorch

This project aims to implement an image classification model using Python and PyTorch. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify images into different predefined categories.

## Project Overview
Image classification is a common task in computer vision where an algorithm learns to identify and assign labels to images based on their visual features. PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, will be utilized for developing the image classification model.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Obtain a suitable dataset for image classification. This dataset should consist of labeled images that cover various categories/classes. In this project, the dataset used is CIFAR10.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform necessary preprocessing steps on the dataset, which includes resizing and normalization.
3. **Model Architecture**: Design the architecture of the image classification model using PyTorch. This involves constructing a deep neural network with convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and an output layer.
4. **Model Training**: Train the image classification model using the prepared dataset. This step involves feeding the training data through the model, calculating the loss, and optimizing the model's parameters using techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy and precision will be used to measure the model's effectiveness.
6. **Model Deployment**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-world image classification tasks. This may involve integrating the model into an application or serving it through an API for inference.
